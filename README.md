Rice is Asia's most significant and major staple crop, particularly in the Philippines. The agricultural sector generates 14 percent of the country's  GDP and employs 13 million people (32% of the total workforce) (Arnaoudov et al., n.d.).
Therefore, identifying insect pests and beneficial insects accurately to target pesticides only on insect pests is necessary to avoid sustained economic damage and retain beneficial insects in the rice fields.


The researchers aimed to develop a mobile application for Insect Pest Identification with Prescribed Pesticide on Rice fields Using SSD MobileNet Model on Deep Learning.

-	Develop a system that will utilize SSD MobileNet Model to detect and identify insect pests on rice fields.
-	Develop a mobile application that gives farmers information about the insect pest's name and recommended pesticides.
-	Together with an IT Expert, evaluate the application's accuracy detection based on Mean Average Precision (mAP).
-	Evaluate the application performance based on ISO 25010 along with an IT Expert, Department of Agriculture and Farmers.

Each one of the objectives were successfully achieved and tackled.
