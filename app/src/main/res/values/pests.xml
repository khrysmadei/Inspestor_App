    <string name="gph_sci">Nephotettix nigropictus</string>
    <string name="gph_des">A leafhopper is the common name for any species from the family Cicadellidae. These minute insects, colloquially known as hoppers,
                            are plant feeders that suck plant sap from grass, shrubs, or trees. Their hind legs are modified for jumping, and are covered with
                            hairs that facilitate the spreading of a secretion over their bodies that acts as a water repellent and
                            carrier of pheromones.[1] They undergo a partial metamorphosis, and have various host associations, varying
                            from very generalized to very specific. Some species have a cosmopolitan distribution, or occur throughout the
                            temperate and tropical regions. Some are pests or vectors of plant viruses and phytoplasmas.[1] The family is
                            distributed all over the world, and constitutes the second-largest hemipteran family, with at least 20,000 described species.</string>

    <string name="rgb_sci"> Paraeuscosmetus pallicomis</string>
    <string name="rgb_des">The world population continues to rise steeply every year, this rapid growth must be balanced by a sufficient increase in food,
        clothing, and housing. Rice is the staple food for a majority of Indonesians, thus its availability must be preserved. National food security has
        experienced stagnation and is not yet adequate to fulfill the dietary needs of the country. In efforts to increase the production of rice, the
        influence of various biotic and abiotic factors plays a determining role. One such factor is plant-destroying organisms such as mice, rice white
        stemborers, brown planthoppers, rice tungro virus, and the attacks of new pests like the rice grain bug, Paraeuscosmetus pallicomis Dallas
        (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) (Patta et al. 2009).</string>

    <!--Leaffolder-->
    <string name="lf_name">Rice Grain Bug</string>
    <string name="lf_sci"> Cnaphalocrocis medinalis</string>
    <string name="lf_des">TThe adult rice leaffolder is a yellow-brown moth. Leaffolder caterpillars fold the rice leaves around
themselves and attach the leaf margins together with silk strands. Each female lays around 300 eggs at
night during a lifecycle of three to 10 days. Larvae are yellow, turn yellowish‐green with brown heads as
they mature, and are about 12‐25 mm long. Each larva can make two to four folded leaves. Pupa is about
9-12 mm long and is found inside the rolled leaf. Adults are yellow brown in color. Adults usually emerge in
the evening. Females lay eggs at night.</string>
