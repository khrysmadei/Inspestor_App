    <string name="gph_des">A leafhopper is the common name for any species from the family Cicadellidae.
        These minute insects, colloquially known as hoppers, are plant feeders that suck plant sap from
        grass, shrubs, or trees. Their hind legs are modified for jumping, and are covered with
        hairs that facilitate the spreading of a secretion over their bodies that acts as a water repellent and
        carrier of pheromones.[1] They undergo a partial metamorphosis, and have various host associations, varying
        from very generalized to very specific. Some species have a cosmopolitan distribution, or occur throughout the
        temperate and tropical regions. Some are pests or vectors of plant viruses and phytoplasmas.[1] The family is
        distributed all over the world, and constitutes the second-largest hemipteran family, with at least 20,000
        described species.</string>
